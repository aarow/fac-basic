                        years of marriage – dedicated to the loving care of her

                        The Grays are the parents of Declan Gray, 25, and Amanda
                        Gray, who was killed by a poisoning of straight Fentanyl
                        on January 11, 2018 at the age of 24. The Gray family
                        battled with acute mental illness throughout Amanda’s
                        life, and her intermittent substance abuse in the last 2
                        years before her passing.<br/>
                        Michael and Nancy founded The Actus Foundation, a
                        501©(3) charitable organization, in 2018. The Foundation
                        advocates treating the entirety of the illicit drug
                        death epidemic in America, including the largely
                        forgotten constituency of intermittent users. Most
                        notable are the acutely mentally ill, who abuse opioids
                        or other drugs (prescription and non-prescription) in a
                        search for symptom relief from tragically under-treated
                        diseases.

                  <p>
                        The introduction of Synthetic Opioid Chemicals (a.k.a.
                        Fentanyl) into the illicit drug supply stream is nothing
                        less than a paradigm shift1 to the decades-long “Opioid
                        Crisis” in the USA. This means all aspects of illicit
                        drug use must be considered to save lives, since any
                        single instance of illicit opioid use may lead to death.
                        The time to see the threat as related only to “addicts”
                        and “overdose” is long past; indeed, it is the old
                        paradigm.

                        Michael is a popular speaker, offering unique analyses
                        and suggestions for creative solutions to a new problem,
                        i.e., an old problem with a recently altered paradigm1.
                        Michael walks participants through the murky world of
                        the drug problem clarifying the threat and dispelling
                        myths. He is advisor to numerous Congressional Members
                        and a close partner to the Chairs and Ranking Members of
                        key committees. He has testified before Congress and has
                        three times been a guest of the White House. The
                        Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy
                        (the “Drug Czar) and its Director, Mr. James W. Carroll,
                        is a close partner.

                        The Actus Foundation also advocates for the mentally
                        ill, striving to deliver the message that mental illness
                        is a disease the entire family suffers, and suffers in
                        isolation; there are no well-worn paths to solutions
                        available to those in chronic states of mental illness,
                        as there are for medical patients. For all our success
                        in medical science – diagnostic practices,
                        treatment/care and patient advocacy – our nation has
                        left behavioral science in the stone age. Our practice
                        of psychiatric care – diagnostic practices,
                        treatment/care and patient advocacy – is the ugly
                        stepchild hidden in the attic as the country proudly
                        displays her medical science wonders to the world.

                        this drug epidemic and illicit fentanyl. She has
                        completed two independent research projects studying
                        high impact areas in Ohio, which is ground zero for this
                        epidemic, and around the nation. She has presented her

                        educating the public and sounding the alarm regarding

                        Most importantly, she suffers an anguish shared by more
                        than 100,000 American families: she lost her lost her
                        only daughter Tiffany to counterfeit pills (“Percocet”)
                        containing heroin and illicit fentanyl, on February 2,
                        2015. Tiffany was not a drug user, nor was she addicted
                        to anything. She was given a single dose of “Percocet"
                        (fake) by someone she knew, when suffering an injury for
                        which, ironically, she was not prescribed pain
                        medications due to the newer, more restrictive
                        prescribing practices. Tiffany was the victim of the new
                        paradigm of the Drug Crisis; the non-addicted victim.
                        Like so many bereaved parents, Virginia wanted to save
                        other children in the crosshairs of Fentanyl, and with
                        that save other mothers and fathers the anguish she
                        feels each day without her precious Tiffany. To do so,
                        she founded Parents Against Illicit Narcotics (P-A-I-N)
                        to promote drug awareness and prevention efforts in our
                        communities. This is accomplished through collaborative
                        efforts with local grass roots organizations who promote
                        drug awareness and education to the general public
                        through a website and ongoing research projects. Mrs.
                        Krieger is a founder and Board Director of the Fentanyl
                        Awareness Coalition, a national organization bringing
                        together the voices of those living victims of Synthetic
                        Drugs.

                  <p>Once he became involved, he immediately came to the conclusion that it was imperative to bring as many Fentanyl Advocacy and Awareness groups under one umbrella, noting that there is power in numbers; hence, the idea for a coalition came to light.</p>

                  <p>Amy is a yoga &amp; fitness instructor, small business owner, board member of Alexander Neville Foundation (ANF), and mother of two from Laguna Niguel. Alexander, her first-born son, 
                  lost his life from fentanyl. He was fourteen with high school and his whole life still ahead of him. Alex was in an experimental phase,
                  took a single pill one night and never woke up.</p>
                  <p>Since losing her son, Amy has devoted her time to continuing to raise her daughter and bringing greater awareness of 
                  fentanyl to the general public. Her efforts have brought her in touch with experts in every area of the fentanyl/opioid crisis including:
                  DEA officials, prosecutors, Southern California county sheriffs, California state legislators, rehabilitation counselors, teachers, 
                  and young adults like her son, Alex. Each interaction informs her efforts and allows her to spread this message.</p>
                  <p>Amy is currently working with Capistrano Unified School District PTA organization to share her knowledge with parents and students.
                  In addition, she is actively persuing legislation at a state level and building a network and larger base of volunteers to 
                  inform the public.</p>
